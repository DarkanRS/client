<ins>What is Darkan RSPS?</ins><br>
Darkan is a 2012 Remake of the latest update #727 right before EOC was released. Out of all the emulators I have ever seen from the 2012 RSPS community this is the most accurate build project I have ever seen. 

<ins>Vanilla client</ins><br>
Trent, the owner of Darkan, maintains the vanilla client for build #727. This repo is forked from that vanilla client. You can switch between Vanilla and my custom client any time.
